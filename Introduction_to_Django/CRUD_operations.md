- `bookshelf` is added to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- `bookshelf/models.py` has `Book` with the exact fields + max_length
- migrations exist under `bookshelf/migrations/`
- the five `.md` files exist and include both commands and outputs
- everything is committed under: `Alx_DjangoLearnLab/Introduction_to_Django`
